title: Oh no it's actually decent
---

So, I took some training from the corporate overlords recently. It was presented by one of the big tech companies and was about "Agentic AI".

This was my first time hands-on with LLMs in general since GitHub Copilot preview, and my first time using "agent" mode in a coding assistant. While it's still just spicy autocomplete under the hood, it's _good enough_ for a surprising number of use-cases. Instead of getting confused, it can now break goals down into tasks that can be taken one step at a time. Instead of making things up, it can seek out information on its own from various sources. You could actually rely on it to do the bulk of your work.

This should be terrifying. Even beyond replacing the core of what I do as an engineer, the same applies to any domain that an agent can be developed for. What I really fear is that these companies are injecting these agents into as many facets of our lives and workflows as possible, counting on our laziness to just accept them as convenience. The result will be a new form of rent-seeking that costs us our wallets and/or our jobs as it slowly erodes and replaces our own capacity to do anything on our own.

I've caught a glimpse of a world where, instead of improving ourselves, we cosplay as geniuses propped up by systems we no longer understand. We just pray to the machine spirits and perform the ancient rites. Warhammer 40k once seemed silly with how it treated its technology, but now it seems downright prophetic.

I was hoping that this stuff would collide with reality sooner rather than later, but it seems that reality is that it's good enough to survive. I still think there will still be a bubble that bursts, but it'll be one from overbuilding/overinvesting rather than the tech itself crashing and burning. So we'll get all the negative economic impacts, but none of the good that would come with this shit being dead and buried.

Honestly, I may look back on this later and wonder how I was so against this tech, but for now, I'm genuinely scared.
