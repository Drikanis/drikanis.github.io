title: Doing Better
---

I've been getting increasingly frustrated at work lately. While some of this is directed, rightly I feel, at out-of-touch leadership, I've been getting more frustrated at my peers as of late.

It's weird to feel like I'm consistently underperforming, not living up to my own high expectations, while at the same time repeatedly watching others completely botch their own tasks.

I know this is purely a _me_ problem and that I need to readjust my expectations and learn patience for myself and others around me, but it's still frustrating to be let down. I just want to be better at letting go of that frustration.
